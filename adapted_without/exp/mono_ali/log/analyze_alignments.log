The optional-silence phone sil occupies 13.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 88.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 1.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 3.1 hours of data, or 2.7 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,16.9,42)
